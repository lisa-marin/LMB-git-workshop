### Licencing.  
- Why do we licence?   
- Who are we licencing to?   
* Couple of exercises:    
       • Whiteboard brainstorming exercise – what software licences have you heard of or come across?   
       • Allocate a licence to groups and get them to find a copy of it. Quick (3 min presentation of why
it would/would not meet the needs of their software project)- (Ditch this one if time is short).  

[Slides used from SoftwareSaved](https://softwaresaved.github.io/software-licensing-workshop/#/).  
• Practical - take a Flashcard. Look at the scenario printed on it - in your group discuss and decide upon
which if any licence is best. (Quick report back if time}.
